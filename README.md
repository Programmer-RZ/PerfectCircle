# Perfect Circle
Two short python scripts to get the 99.9% and 0.1% on [Draw a Perfect Circle](https://neal.fun/perfect-circle/).

You need to install pyautogui


## Note
In both scripts, there is a variable called ```center_of_circle```. You must change it to the position of the white dot relative to your screen.
